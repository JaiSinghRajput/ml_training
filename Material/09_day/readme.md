## linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values. It establishes a linear relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).

### Formula
The basic linear regression equation is:
y = mx + b
where:
- y is the predicted value (dependent variable)
- m is the slope (coefficient)
- x is the input feature (independent variable) 
- b is the y-intercept (bias term)

For multiple features, it becomes:
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
where:
- β₀ is the bias term
- β₁ to βₙ are coefficients
- x₁ to xₙ are input features

### Key Points
1. **Assumptions**
   - Linear relationship between variables
   - Independence of observations
   - Normal distribution of residuals
   - Homoscedasticity (constant variance)

2. **Cost Function**
   - Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - MSE = (1/n)Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
   - Goal is to minimize MSE

3. **Optimization**
   - Gradient Descent algorithm
   - Iteratively updates parameters
   - Learning rate controls step size

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - R-squared (coefficient of determination)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

5. **Advantages**
   - Simple and interpretable
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Works well for linear relationships

6. **Limitations**
   - Assumes linear relationship
   - Sensitive to outliers
   - May underfit complex patterns

#### evaluation matrix
- **R-squared**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
  - R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
  - SS_res = Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
  - SS_tot = Σ(y_actual - mean(y_actual))²
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
    - MAE = (1/n)Σ|y_actual - y_predicted|
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of the average squared differences between actual and predicted values.   
    - RMSE = √((1/n)Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
    - MSE = (1/n)Σ(y_actual - y_predicted)²
- **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.
    - Adjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²)(n - 1) / (n - p - 1)]
    - n = number of observations
    - p = number of predictors
- **F-statistic**: Tests the overall significance of the regression model.
    - F = (Explained Variance / p) / (Residual Variance / (n - p - 1))
    - p = number of predictors
    - n = number of observations
- **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**: Measures the quality of a model relative to others.   
    - AIC = 2k - 2ln(L)
    - k = number of parameters
    - L = likelihood of the model
- **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: Similar to AIC but includes a penalty for the number of parameters.
    - BIC = ln(n)k - 2ln(L)
    - n = number of observations
    - k = number of parameters
    - L = likelihood of the model
